# discord-protocol
A P2P* communication protocol using discord

This is a WIP and proof of concept project for me to improve my rust knowledge. So the code might suck. Which means I'm open for PR's that will improve the code :3

Wouldn't be useful in applications that require low latency high throughput networking. But for applications that doesn't need low latency can be used with this. I'll update the repo once I have other demos.

Contact me on discord if you have funny ideas like this lol
